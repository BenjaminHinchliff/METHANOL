# PythonScript
PythonScript is a lightweight linear high-level low-level programming language that compiles to Python. Specifications can be found in SPECIFICATION.md. No compiler exists yet, that will come in the future, and will most likely be written in Java and make use of regex in order to compile.

### Authors
PythonScript is developed by: [SirNapkin1334](https://github.com/SirNapkin1334), [Benjamin Hinchliff](https://github.com/BenjaminHinchliff), and Keith Millar.
